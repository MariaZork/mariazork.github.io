I’m proficient in such machine learning and deep learning areas as computer vision, natural language processing, predictive analytics. Also I have more than seven years of experience in science and strong background as a researcher. I have 19 publications in well-known foreign and Russian magazines. My main programming language is Python (with additional libraries such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn), also I’m using Keras and PyTorch for deep learning. Due to mathematical education, I have background in pure mathematics and statistics.
